# Prepend update-paths.js With `./`  (2025-05-26 21:29:55)

DEV. NOTE: root cause of the issue I was facing:

when uploading a new article to dev.to, the relative paths of images in the article were being translated to incorrect paths. For example, `./assets/an_image.png` was being translated to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OdyAsh/odyash-dev.to/master/e-blog-posts/vibe-coding/assets/an_image.png`. Notice the `e-blog-posts` part instead of `the-blog-posts`. After chatting with Copilot on the GitHub platform itself ([here](https://github.com/copilot/share/00134322-02e0-8c56-9052-064a24bf28b3)), I realized that the issue was that the `update-paths.js` file didn't prepend `./` to the relative paths in the `dev-to-git.json` file.



_**User**_

update the code in #file:update-paths.js  so that the final returned output contains a ./ , for example, instead of this in dev-to-git.json:

```
[
  {
    "id": 2478114,
    "relativePathToArticle": "the-blog-posts/vibe-coding/01-surviving-the-vibe-coding-trend.md"
  }
]

```

we now have this:

```
[
  {
    "id": 2478114,
    "relativePathToArticle": "./the-blog-posts/vibe-coding/01-surviving-the-vibe-coding-trend.md"
  }
]

```

````

````
The code in `update-paths.js` is now updated so that all `relativePathToArticle` entries in `dev-to-git.json` will start with ``, for example: `01-surviving-the-vibe-coding-trend.md`.

Let me know if you want to run the script or need further changes!
