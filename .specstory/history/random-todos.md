The objective of this file is to write todos here before ending a coding session, so that I can pick them up later without the initial friction of remembering what I was doing.

The todos in this file will be written in captial if they're still not done, and like this `finished to-do` if they're done.

<!-- finished to-do:  
   1. Write VSCode task that will auto copy mermaid code snippets from a .md file to a neighbouring mermaid/*.mmd file per each mermaid code snippet in the .md file.
   2. Then, for each .mmd file, auto-generate a .png file for it in a neighbouring assets/*.png file with the same name as its corresponding .mmd file.
      1. E.g., if the .mmd file is called `mermaid/ai-vibe-brain-diagram.mmd`, then the generated .png file will be called `assets/ai-vibe-brain-diagram.png`.
   3. Then, auto-replace the mermaid code snippets in the .md file with the generated .png files.
   4. Write another VSCode task that does the reverse (i.e., given that the .md file contains .png files, then search for the corresponding .mmd files and replace them if any).
   5. Note 1: the first task mentioned in step 1. and 2. and 3. should also include a check to see if the .mmd file already exists, and if it does, then it should not create a new one.
   6. Note 2: Since there's no way to guess the names of the to-be-generated .mmd files, assume that the first line in a mermaid code snippet will be a `%% file-name-here` comment. If not found, then name the .mmd file as `mermaid/mermaid-<sequential-number>.mmd`.

Note from the future: the above steps might not closely reflect what's currently in the code, but I left them here just for you to see how I drafted my thought process back then (as I then gave them to copilot).
