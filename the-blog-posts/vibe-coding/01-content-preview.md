Assalamu Alaikum :] 🙌

I created an app called **Ayahs Audio Downloader** ⏬🎧. Demo link: [1]. HLD: [image-1].

The aim of this post, however, is to share how I built it using AI, and how you can do the same with your own projects.

In my dev.to article: [2] [image-2] 📝, I break down the process into four levels of detail:

1. **lvl 1**: High-level design and goals.
2. **lvl 2**: Tech choices and user interaction.
3. **lvl 3**: Breaking down the work into a pipeline of tasks.
4. **lvl 4**: Writing functions that do one thing (i.e., task) well.

Illustrations for the 4 levels: [image-3]. 

Moreover, I talk about these levels in the context of AI ̷v̷i̷b̷i̷n̷g̷  coding, and the degree to which AI 🤖 can help you with each level [image-4].

Finally, I give a shoutout to a couple of AI tools 🛠️ to boost your coding productivity, e.g., Deep Wiki, which genearted great documentation for my app's GitHub repo in a few minutes :] [3] [image-5].

Title of my article: "Surviving The Vibe Coding Trend" [2]. So hopefully it will give you an 💡 on how to 🏄‍♂️ the AI coding wave... instead of wiping out. 😅

Side note: You can see the prompts 💭 that I used with copilot to build the application here: [4].
